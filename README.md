# LuoRain
A Typecho theme based on mdui and reproduces the layout of [typecho-theme-material](https://github.com/idawnlight/typecho-theme-material).

Currently there's no way to customize theme through Typecho settings, but you can modify the source code to do it.

This theme does not completely reproduce the functions of [typecho-theme-material](https://github.com/idawnlight/typecho-theme-material), because I made it for my demand.

You can perfect it by submitting Pull Requests if you want.
